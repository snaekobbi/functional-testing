            The system shall support non-standard hyphenation. By non-standard hyphenation we mean
            that the spelling of a word can change when it is hyphenated. The braille translation of
            a hyphenated word can only change because the spelling changes, not e.g. because it is
            contracted in some other way. In other words the definition of non-standard hyphenation
            is not “extrapolated to braille”.
